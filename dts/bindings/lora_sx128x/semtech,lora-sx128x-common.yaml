properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's NRESET signal.

      This signal is open-drain, active-low as interpreted by the modem.

  busy-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's BUSY signal.

      This signal is high when the radio is ready to accept commands, and
      low when it is processing a command.

  dio1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO1 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

  dio2-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO2 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

      Note that this conflicts with dio2-as-rf-switch.

  dio3-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description: |
      GPIO connected to the radio's DIO3 signal. This GPIO will be used as
      a generic IRQ line from the chip.

      Note that this conflicts with dio3-as-tcxo-enable.
